# Papyr-Templates
A place to collect and share PDFs, images, etc. formated for the QuirkLogic Papyr.

Everything is better with open source participation from a community, lets build one for Papyr. 

Things To Consider
------------------
Papyr resolution is 1650(W)x2200(H) at 207 DPI.

Until more file types are supported by Papyr, stand alone files should be in PDF format, and background
templates should be in a supported image format (PNG, JPEG, PDF, etc).


*Getting Started*
-----------------
There are Microsoft [Word](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Word-Template.dotx) and [PowerPoint](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/PowerPoint-Template.pptx) as well as [Gimp](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Gimp-Template.xcf) template files available that are preset to the appropriate size. Download these and get creative.

Feel free to contact me via the Issues tab and or email for ideas about better organization, or make a pull request.

# Papyr-Templates
A place to collect and share PDFs, images, etc. formated for the QuirkLogic Papyr.

Everything is better with open source participation from a community, lets build one for Papyr. 

Things To Consider
------------------
Papyr resolution is 1650(W)x2200(H) at 207 DPI.

Until more file types are supported by Papyr, stand alone files should be in PDF format, and background
templates should be in a supported image format (PNG, JPEG, PDF, etc).


*Getting Started*
-----------------
There are Microsoft [Word](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Word-Template.dotx) and [PowerPoint](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/PowerPoint-Template.pptx) as well as [Gimp](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Gimp-Template.xcf) template files available that are preset to the appropriate size. Download these and get creative.

If you come across problems, raise an [Issue](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/issues) in the tab above, or if you have new ideas about the structure of this repo, or anything else, feel free to hop into the [Discussions](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/discussions).

**Not offiliated with QuirkLogic in any way, just a dude.

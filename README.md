# Papyr-Templates
A place to collect and share PDFs, images, etc. formated for the QuirkLogic Papyr.

Everything is better with open source participation from a community, lets build one for Papyr. 

Things To Consider
------------------
Papyr resolution is 1650(W)x2200(H) at 207 DPI.

Until more file types are supported by Papyr, stand alone files should be in PDF format, and background
templates should be PNG/JPEG images.


*Getting Started*
-----------------
There are Microsoft [Word](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Word-Template.dotx) and [PowerPoint](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/PowerPoint-Template.pptx) as well as [Gimp](https://github.com/kaschau/Papyr-Templates/blob/main/Gimp-Template.xcf) template files available that are preset to the appropriate size. Download these and get creative.
